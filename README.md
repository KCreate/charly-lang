# The Charly programming language

This is my try at writing an interpreter of a dynamic language from scratch with my bare hands. It is implemented in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) at has no dependencies.

# Syntax

__Declaring a variable__
```charly
let number = 900;
let float = 5.5928;
let string = "Hello World";
let boolean = true;
let array = [1, "charly", false];
let nullvalue = null;
let object = {
  let name = "leonard";
  let age = 16;
};
```

__Declaring a function__
```charly
func callback(value, callback) {
  callback(value);
};

let result = callback(25, func(value) {
  value * 2;
});

result; # => 50
```

__Repeat & While loops__
```charly
repeat(5, func() {
  print("Hello");
});

let i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  print("In a while loop");
  i = i + 1;
};
```

__User Input__
```charly
# Strings
let input = gets();
print(input);

# Numbers
let input_number = Number(gets());
print(input_number);
```

__Type casting and checking__
```charly
typeof(25); # => Numeric
typeof(25.5); # => Numeric
typeof("Charly"); # => String
typeof([1, 2, 3]); # => Array
typeof(null); # => Null
typeof(false); # => Boolean

let number = 25;
print("Number is: " + number);
```

__Including other files__
```charly
require("external.charly"); # Include a file in the current directory
require("someotherlibrary"); # Include the someotherlibrary from the standard library
```

__Working with arrays__
```charly
let array = [1, 2, 3];
array = append(array, 4);
print(array); # => 1, 2, 3, 4
```

__Classes & Objects__
```charly
class Person {
  let name;
  let age;

  func constructor(_name, _age) {
    name = _name;
    age = _age;
  };
};

let leonard = new(Person, "Leonard", 16);
print(leonard.name); # "Leonard"
print(leonard.age); # 16
```

# CLI options
```
charly filename [options...]

<options>
 --ast              # Display the abstract syntax tree
 --tokens           # Display a list of tokens found by lexical analysis
 --noexec           # Don't execute the program (Useful if you just want to dump AST's)
 --noprelude        # Don't load the prelude file (You'll have to load your own standard library yourself)
```
