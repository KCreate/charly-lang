# The Charly programming language

This is my try at writing an interpreter of a dynamic language from scratch with my bare hands. It is implemented in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) at has no dependencies.

# Syntax

Semicolons are completely optional!

__Declaring a variable__
```charly
let number = 900
let float = 5.5928
let string = "Hello World"
let boolean = true
let array = [1, "charly", false]
let nullvalue = null
let object = {
  let name = "leonard"
  let age = 16
}
```

__Declaring constants__
```charly
const PI = 3.14159265358979323846
const E = 2.7182818284590451

PI = 4 # Cannot redeclare constant PI
```

__Declaring a function__
```charly
func callback(value, callback) {
  callback(value)
}

let result = callback(25, func(value) {
  value * 2
})

result # => 50
```

__Repeat & While loops__
```charly
5.times(func(i) {
  print("Hello")
})

let i = 0
while (i < 10) {
  print("In a while loop")
  i = i + 1
}
```

__User Input__
```charly
# Strings
let input = gets()
print(input)

# Numbers
let input_number = gets().to_n()
print(input_number)
```

__Primitive types__
```charly
25.type()                           # => Numeric
25.5.type()                         # => Numeric
"Charly".type()                     # => String
[1, 2, 3].type()                    # => Array
null.type()                         # => Null
false.type()                        # => Boolean
(class Box {}).type()               # => Class
(func() {}).type()                  # => Function
{ let name = "charly" }.type()     # => Object
```

__Including other files__
```charly
# Include a file in the current directory
require("external.charly")

# Include the someotherlibrary from the standard library
require("someotherlibrary")
```

__Working with arrays__
```charly
let array = [1, 2, 3]
array.push(4)
print(array) # => [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

__Classes & Objects__
```charly
class Person {
  let name
  let age

  func constructor(name, age) {
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
  }
}

let leonard = Person("Leonard", 16)
print(leonard.name) # "Leonard"
print(leonard.age) # 16
```

# Everything is an object... kind of
When you write `5`, the interpreter actually treats it as a primitive. There are no funny castings or object instantiations. You can normally write code like `2 + 5` and it will work. Once you do something like `5.times(func(){})`, the interpreter searches the current scope for an object called `Numeric` and checks if there is a function called `times` on it. If it finds the method, it injects a variable called `self` into the function's stack and executes it.

This allows the interpreter to reuse the same object for all primitives.

This principle applies to all language primitives. The `Array` object for example, specifies a method called `push` which inserts an element into the array.

# Installation
I have only tested this on macOS 10.12.
It should theoretically work on linux systems too.

You will need a working [crystal](http://crystal-lang.org/) installation.

To install the `charly` command and automatically copy it to the `/usr/bin` folder, run `install.sh`.
You will be prompted for your admin password (used to copy to `/usr/bin`).

# CLI options
```
$ charly -h
Usage: charly [options] filename [arguments]
    -f FLAG, --flag FLAG             Set a flag
    -h, --help                       Show this help
    -v, --version                    Show the version number

Flags:
    ast                              Display AST's of parsed programs
    tokens                           Display tokens of parsed programs
    noexec                           Disable execution
    noprelude                        Don't load the prelude file
    stackdump                        Dump the top-level stack at the end of execution
```
